## Overview

This is a slightly modified version of the actual GetDeals website. See it in action at https://getdeals.co.in.

## Getting Started

**Note: You will be needing a verified GitHub account for this. Sign up for one now if you haven't already.**

This version was created keeping non-programmers in mind. Even though you do have to edit some code, but follow the instructions correctly and you'll be running your own search engine and price comparison website in no time.
